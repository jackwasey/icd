#'   codes which appear in the master list, not just syntactically valid codes.
#'   Since nearly valid, out-dated or new codes may be missed, not limiting to
#'   'real' values will be useful. Ultimately, there will need to be annual (and
#'   all-time) master lists of codes and the ability to test against a given
#'   master list given the year of the ICD-9 coding.
