\Abstract{
Medical research often describes the existing diseases (comorbidities)
in its study populations, and retrospective research may rely on this
information for risk adjustment. Sets of International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) codes are often used for high-level classification of
patients into comorbidities (e.g., `Cancer' or `Heart Disease') to help
summarize characteristics of a population. Similar tools were not
available in \proglang{R}, and do not scale to big data sets. The
\pkg{icd} extension for \proglang{R} includes validated mappings of ICD
codes to comorbidities, and uses an efficient, fast and scalable
algorithm to apply these mappings to patient data. This enables
reproducible workflows with hundreds of millions of patient records as
are increasingly seen in large national and international databases.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

ICD diagnostic codes are used to define tens of thousands of diseases.
Originally from the World Health Organization (WHO), their purpose was
to allow epidemiologists to study global health
\citep{WHO_Internationalclassificationdiseases_2018}. In the USA, and
elsewhere, the WHO ICD codes have been extended for administrative
purposes by the government Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS), notably for billing \citep{CMS_CentersMedicareMedicaid_2018}. All
over the world, ICD codes are the primary method by which diseases are
recorded, often using national variants. This makes ICD codes important
in many kinds of medical research, e.g., for defining national health
metrics \citep{Lee_Predictingmortalitypatients_2003}, and in many of
clinical studies, especially those in which groups of patients are
compared \citep[e.g.,][]{frank_risk-adjusted_2014}. \pkg{icd} was made
to meet the need for ICD code interpretation in \proglang{R}, and, in
particular, it is designed to compute comorbidities quickly, enabling a
reproducible workflow when used with big or small data.

\hypertarget{what-is-a-comorbidity}{%
\subsection{What is a comorbidity?}\label{what-is-a-comorbidity}}

Given there are tens of thousands of diagnostic codes, it is extremely
difficult to use them directly in most statistical models: there are a
few relatively common ICD codes, but there is a long tail to the
frequency distribution (see Figure \ref{fig:longtail} for an example)
since even common diagnoses can be finely sub-divded. The almost
universal solution is to group these codes in a standardized way
\citep[e.g.,][]{quan_coding_2005, elixhauser_comorbidity_1998}, and to
use the presence and absence of any disease code in the comorbidity
groups as covariates in models. The term comorbidity describes a disease
which is present alongside a primary medical problem.

For example, a diabetic patient presents to hospital with a stroke:
diabetes is the comorbidity and stroke is the presenting complaint.
During or after an hospital admission, medical coders review the records
and assign specific ICD (and other) codes. In this example, the patient
might get the ICD-10 code E11.2 meaning `Type 2 diabetes mellitus with
renal complications,' and I63.0 meaning `Cerebral infarction due to
thrombosis of precerebral arteries.' In this case, the comorbidities
might be regarded as: `Diabetes' and `Renal'. The term comorbidity
generally refers to classes of diseases, not specific diagnoses, and
that is how the term is used in the rest of this paper.

\subsection{Uses of comorbidities}\label{uses-of-comorbidities}}

\hypertarget{comparing-groups}{%
\subsubsection{Comparing groups}\label{comparing-groups}}

Almost every report of a medical investigation includes a table showing
the characteristics of the groups comprising a study population. (For
example, see table 2 in \citet{frank_risk-adjusted_2014}.) One purpose
of this table is to show any differences between the groups under
investigation. Things like age and weight can be compared numerically,
whereas the tens of thousands of distinct diagnostic codes may only be
compared by grouping into comorbidities. It is of central importance to
retrospective studies that confounding is minimized by understanding
differences in comorbidities between groups, then by risk adjustment. In
randomized studies, this is achieved by recruiting enough patients and
randomly assigning them to treatment: comorbidities of interest are
still needed to demonstrate that recruitment was free from bias and that
the sample size large enough. It is helpful if different studies use the
same criteria, and ideally the same methods, for establishing these
comorbidities. One main purpose of \pkg{icd} is to enable standardized
calculations in \proglang{R} using extremely well validated definitions
of comorbidities, e.g., \citet{quan_updating_2011} and
\citet{AgencyforHealthcareResearchandQuality_Elixhausercomorbiditysoftware_2018}
only offer \proglang{SAS} code for this task.

\hypertarget{risk-adjustment}{%
\subsubsection{Risk adjustment}\label{risk-adjustment}}

Identifying differences between groups in retrospective medical data is
not hard: they almost always exist. The eternal challenge of
retrospective research is to account for those differences to make
causal inferences. A common, somewhat historic strategy is to use
scoring systems to encapsulate the severity of the comorbidities in one
number, for example the Charlson Score \citep{charlson_new_1987}.
Another approach is to use propensity scores or propensity matching: the
inputs to propensity models include comorbidity information, which is a
simple score like the Charlson Score, or a binary representation of the
presence or absence of comorbidities for each patient or patient-visit
(See \protect\hyperlink{terminology}{Terminology}). More sophisticated
matching also relies on comorbidities for better risk adjustment,
\citep[e.g.,][]{diamond_genetic_2012}.

\hypertarget{mapping-icd-codes-onto-comorbidities}{%
\subsection{Mapping ICD codes onto
comorbidities}\label{mapping-icd-codes-onto-comorbidities}}

The ubiquity of ICD codes means there is a long history of grouping them
to form comorbidities, and these standardized groups have been used for
decades as the basis for medical studies. As revisions of the ICD codes
have appeared, and various diseases have waxed and waned in
significance, people have worked to categorize them into these
standardized comorbidity groups. The two main groups were developed by
Charlson \citep{charlson_new_1987}, and Elixhauser
\citep{elixhauser_comorbidity_1998}. Such mappings between comorbidity
categories and sets of diagnostic codes will henceforth be called,
comorbidity maps. The benefits of using existing comorbidity maps are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  consistency and comparability with existing research
\item
  they are well validated
\item
  researchers can avoid the effort and errors involved in developing new
  comorbidity schemes.
\end{itemize}

Charlson did not initially use ICD codes to define the comorbidities,
but various authors \citep[e.g.,][]{quan_coding_2005} have since
classified ICD codes into those 17 comorbidity categories. Elixhauser
\citeyearpar{elixhauser_comorbidity_1998} developed ICD-based
comorbidities for 31 diseases, and the US-based Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) used this as a foundation for its own
comorbidity groups
\citep{AgencyforHealthcareResearchandQuality_Elixhausercomorbiditysoftware_2018}.
Elixhauser and Charlson comorbidities have undergone refinement over the
years, especially by \citet{quan_updating_2011} whose meticulous work on
ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes has been included in \pkg{icd}, alongside the
AHRQ mappings.

\hypertarget{medical-codes}{%
\subsection{Medical codes}\label{medical-codes}}

Medical coding has a complicated history beginning with epidemiology,
and snowballing to include medical billing and research. There are
several major coding schemes, including the WHO ICD family, various
national modifications and extensions of the WHO ICD codes, the
extensive USA ICD-CM (Clinical Modification), and several unrelated
schemes with similar goals. There are codes for diagnoses, procedures,
medical equipment, and causes and circumstances of disease or injury.
Codes sometimes have detail beyond what seems useful for routine
clinical care, for example:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> library("icd")
R> explain_code("V97.33XD")
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Sucked into jet engine, subsequent encounter"
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Because the WHO ICD is a subset of ICD Clinical Modification, \pkg{icd}
is driven by ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, both of which are available in the
public domain, allowing analysis of WHO codes and more detailed USA or
other national sets of codes. Unfortunately, the WHO exercises copyright
over the international ICD-10 scheme, so it cannot be included. This
does not affect comorbidity computations.

ICD-9 codes are primarily numeric, have fewer codes defined, and have a
more variable format, sometimes with a prefix of V or E. ICD-10 codes
have top-level code in the form of a letter, then two numbers, with a
longer section of mixed numbers and letters after the decimal divider.
Both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes can be presented with or without a decimal
divider, thus there is potential ambiguity between ICD-9 and ICD-10
(e.g., V10 is in both schemes), and between ICD-9 codes without
separators (e.g., 0100 and 100).

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> explain_code(as.icd9("V10"))
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Personal history of malignant neoplasm"
\end{CodeOutput}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> explain_code(as.icd10("V10"))
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Pedal cycle rider injured in collision with pedestrian or animal"
\end{CodeOutput}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> explain_code("0100")
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Primary tuberculous infection"
\end{CodeOutput}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> explain_code("100")
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Leptospirosis"
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{breakdown-of-an-icd-10-code}{%
\subsubsection{Breakdown of an ICD-10
code}\label{breakdown-of-an-icd-10-code}}

This is a breakdown of an ICD-10-CM code, chosen to illustrate the
hierarchical nature of the codes, and difference between WHO ICD-10 and
ICD-10-CM. The following two codes are shared by the WHO definitions and
ICD-10-CM.\footnote{Here the \pkg{icd} function \texttt{explain\_code}
  is used. More detail on this can be found in Section
  \ref{other-functionality}.}

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> explain_code(c("S62", "S62.6"))
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Fracture at wrist and hand level"           
[2] "Fracture of other and unspecified finger(s)"
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

These three are refinements offered only by ICD-10-CM:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> explain_code(c("S62.60", "S62.607", "S62.607S"))
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Fracture of unspecified phalanx of finger"                     
[2] "Fracture of unspecified phalanx of left little finger"         
[3] "Fracture of unspecified phalanx of left little finger, sequela"
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

These codes are all contained in the sub-chapter,
\texttt{Injuries\ To\ The\ Wrist,\ Hand\ And\ Fingers,} (S60 to S69) and
the chapter
\texttt{Injury,\ poisoning\ and\ certain\ other\ consequences\ of\ external\ causes.}
(S00 to T88).

\hypertarget{quirks-of-icd-codes}{%
\subsubsection{Quirks of ICD codes}\label{quirks-of-icd-codes}}

There are multiple possible notations of the same ICD codes, and
ICD-9-CM codes are particularly variable:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  presence or absence of a decimal point divider
\item
  use of X as a filler
\item
  zero-padding for three-digit codes \textless{} 100
\end{itemize}

In real data, ICD codes may not be constrained to a definitive list, so
may contain frankly invalid codes, or codes which are valid in one
edition of ICD, but not another, yet do fall clearly into one
comorbidity.

\hypertarget{motivation-and-goals}{%
\subsection{Motivation and goals}\label{motivation-and-goals}}

The original motivation for \pkg{icd} was lack of any \proglang{R}
software in the Comprehensive \proglang{R} Archive Network (CRAN)
repository, or elsewhere, to compute comorbidities from ICD codes, nor
any data that was easily parsable by \proglang{R} for interpreting ICD
codes or representing the Charlson or Elixhauser schemes or the official
lists of codes themselves.

The requirements at the outset were:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  enable a quickly reproducible workflow which includes a comorbidity
  computation
\item
  accurate computation of Charlson and Elixhauser families of
  comorbidities
\item
  faithful representation of comorbidity maps as intended by the
  original authors, with a reproducible audit trail back to the original
  \proglang{SAS} (SAS Institute, Cary NC, USA) code or published data
\item
  performant enough for big data \citep{simpao_big_2015}: updating the
  input patient data or comorbidity map should be possible without
  waiting minutes or hours to recompute the comorbidities
\item
  extensible to allow addition of other comorbidity maps and scoring
  systems
\end{itemize}

Handling big data well aligns with another goal of enabling analysis of
moderately big health care datasets with modest computing power. WHO ICD
codes are used internationally, and it is important to enable their use
without expensive computing resources, or reliance on the Internet for
cloud computing. An open source licence
\citep[GNU General Public License v3.0][]{gplv3} was chosen for this
reason. This goal also helps an analyst or researcher to use a laptop to
deal with all but the very biggest datasets, avoiding the complexity of
using cloud computing and the risks of moving protected health
information across the internet.

During development it became clear that the following were also
important:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  handling of invalid data to minimize effect on comorbidities
\item
  finding out the meaning of ICD codes
\item
  navigating the ICD code hierarchies
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{main-computational-problems}{%
\subsubsection{Main computational
problems}\label{main-computational-problems}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  String matching
\end{enumerate}

The central computational problem is one of using string matching to map
ICD codes from patient data to the comorbidities, and recording the
results. String matching is a slow operation, and memory intensive; the
innovation described here is the use of matrix algebra to solve the
problem. This requires a brief pre-processing step with string matching,
whereas other solutions use string matching throughout.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Inexact comorbidity definitions
\end{enumerate}

The comorbidity definitions in published literature do not precisely
specify each individual code. This is partly a function of the various
annual and international revisions of ICD codes, and also the need for
brevity in publications, so ranges of codes are specified. For example,
in the Valvular Heart Disease comorbidity in the ICD-9 Elixhauser
scheme, we see it contains the range 394.0 -- 397.1 . In the ICD-10
version of the Elixhauser map, there are many top-level codes, such as
I34, I35 and I36, which themselves are never or rarely used for
diagnostic coding. Therefore, there are few or no exact matches between
candidate ICD codes and the codes or ranges in the comorbidities, so
some kind of string matching must be done, or a determination of whether
a code falls in a specified range. This is dealt with in detail in
Section \ref{derivation-of-the-comorbidity-maps}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Big data
\end{enumerate}

Bulk health care data, even for one hospital, often has hundreds of
thousands or millions of encounters of different types. National
databases and multi-hospital patient registries often have many more.
Initial work using pure \proglang{R} code, with some optimization,
resulted in computations taking minutes for about ten thousand patients.
Although the problem is parallelizable, performance analysis on early
versions using string matching showed that there was a lot of pressure
on the CPU caches, so massive parallelization -- when even an option --
would have had diminishing returns with scaling. This is demonstrated by
the benchmarks in the \protect\hyperlink{results}{Results}.

The problem of determining which patients have which disease classes can
be expressed in pseudocode as nested loops:

\begin{Code}
for each patient-visit, get the ICD codes
  for each ICD code
    for each comorbidity
      search the lists of codes for that comorbidity
      if a matching diagnostic code is found, then
        record that comorbidity for the current patient-visit
\end{Code}

\label{pseudocode}

This is an \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) computation because the search element is
limited to the fixed comorbidity map, thus making it asymptotically
unimportant.

The benchmarks in the \protect\hyperlink{results}{Results} section show
\pkg{icd} is much more efficient than string matching approaches.

Big data solutions cannot often be solved simply by increasing hardware
capacity. The availability of many computing cores in the cloud does not
help an algorithm which is limited to a single thread, or an algorithm
which is ignorant of how CPU memory caching works. \pkg{icd} was
designed to work efficiently on big health care data using parallel
processing, and by minimizing the memory requirements of the problem.

\subsection{Included comorbidity maps}\label{included-comorbidity-maps}}

This package contains mappings to convert ICD codes to comorbidities
using methods from several sources, based on the AHRQ, Charlson or
Elixhauser systems. Updated versions of these lists from
\citet{AgencyforHealthcareResearchandQuality_Elixhausercomorbiditysoftware_2018}
and \citet{quan_updating_2011} are included, along with the original
\citet{elixhauser_comorbidity_1998} mapping. Since some data is provided
in \proglang{SAS} source code format, this package has internal
functions to parse this \proglang{SAS} source code and generate R data
structures. Some lists are transcribed directly from the published
articles, but interpretation of \proglang{SAS} code used for the
original publications is preferable.

For example, here are the names of the comorbidities in the Charlson
map:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> names(icd10_map_charlson)
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
 [1] "MI"          "CHF"         "PVD"         "Stroke"      "Dementia"

[16] "Mets"        "HIV"        
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

and the ICD-10 codes from the first two comorbidities:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> icd10_map_charlson[1:2]
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
$MI

\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Note that these codes are of \texttt{icd10} and \texttt{character}
class, and that they carry the attribute \texttt{icd\_short\_diag} which
is set to \texttt{TRUE}, since there is no decimal divider.

    For ICD-10, this is done at the same time as Item
    \ref{itm:partialstring}, for no additional time complexity.
  \item
    \label{itm:encode} Encode the ICD codes as consecutive integers:
    \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) but could be optimized to \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) by
    using the knowledge that there are now no duplicates.
  \item
    \label{itm:gensparse} Generate a sparse patient-visit matrix, with
    one row per patient, and a column for each ICD code defined by the
    consecutive integers from the previous step: \(\mathcal{O}(n)\)
  \item
    \label{itm:gendense} Generate a dense comorbidity matrix, with one
    column for each comorbidity, and one row for each ICD code:
    \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) in relation to \(n\) patient-visits.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Perform matrix multiplication: \(\mathcal{O}(R_m\cdot n)\) time
  complexity where \(R_m\) is the ratio of non-zero to zero elements per
  row. For typical patient data, the mean is around five to ten codes
  per patient-visit, with many administrative data being limited to
  thirty. This low number compares favorably to the matrix width of tens
  of thousands.\footnote{Sparse matrix multiplication with dense
    matrices is already \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) using the widespread
    Compressed Row -- or Column -- Storage (CRS or CCS) scheme. Even if
    dense matrix multiplication were used, it would still be
    \(\mathcal{O}(n)\), despite being \(\mathcal{O}(n^3)\) in the
    general case: in this problem, only one dimension of one matrix
    grows with increasing patient-visits. These are asymptotic limits
    for time, not for memory or bandwidth.}

\hypertarget{icd-9}{%
\subsubsection{ICD-9}\label{icd-9}}

Step \ref{itm:dataprep} of the algorithm is only applicable to ICD-9
codes. The comorbidity maps for ICD-9 codes already contain all the
syntactically valid permutations of child codes according to the ICD-9
specification. This means exact matching can be done in subsequent
steps. The pre-calculation of the ICD-9 maps is done at package creation
time, using internal functions which are included for reproducibility.

\hypertarget{icd-10}{%
\subsubsection{ICD-10}\label{icd-10}}

ICD-10 codes are more complex and have many more possible permutations:
the same ICD-9 technique could be used, but the ICD-10 maps would be
huge, and vulnerable to unexpected modifications; for example, a
national ICD-10 variant using a different letter suffix which would not
be captured. The solution is to have ICD-10 comorbidity maps which only
include the level of details specified by the original author, often
just the top-level three-digit codes, and use partial string
matching,\footnote{This partial matching is not based on regular
  expressions, but simply identifying whether the more significant
  characters of a longer code match a known parent. e.g., using the
  previous example, if S62.6 appeared in a comorbidity map, then
  S62.607S would be matched.} combining steps \ref{itm:partialstring}
and \ref{itm:intersect} during one scan of the data.

\hypertarget{problem-reduction}{%
\subsection{Problem reduction}\label{problem-reduction}}

There are some major simplifications:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Only a fraction of possible ICD codes typically appear in health data,
  in step \ref{itm:intersect}
\item
  ICD codes are codified as integers in step \ref{itm:encode}
\item
  Sparse matrix representation can be used to dramatically reduce the
  memory requirement of the patient-visit matrix, in step
  \ref{itm:gensparse}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{reduce-number-of-codes}{%
\subsubsection{Reduce number of codes}\label{reduce-number-of-codes}}

Reducing the total number of codes in both patient-visit and comorbidity
data is performed in step \ref{itm:intersect} of the algorithm. For
matrix multiplication, the columns \(n\) of the patient-visit matrix
must match the rows \(q\) of the comorbidity map both in number. This
means a common vocabulary for the codes in the patient-visits and the
comorbidity maps must be established. This is accomplished in step
\ref{itm:encode} by using a factor,\footnote{\proglang{R} uses a data
  structure called a \texttt{factor} in which each element is stored as
  an integer index into an array of strings. The strings are unique,
  whereas the integers may be repeated.} where the levels represent the
intersection of codes from the patient-visit data and the whole
comorbidity map. Thus the integer factor indices become row or column
indices in matrices \(\boldsymbol{A}\) and \(\boldsymbol{B}\)
respectively. i.e., we only need to represent codes which are in both
the patient-visit dad and the comorbidity map, making matrix
\(\boldsymbol{A}\) narrower and matrix \(\boldsymbol{B}\) shorter.
String searching strategies miss this optimization.

Referring back to the pseudocode in Section \ref{pseudocode}, integer
representation would allow much faster binary or linear search, but this
is obviated by a matrix multiplication. Although the matrix
multiplication probably performs more computations than needed, it has
simpler flow control and is a problem for which highly-optimized
solutions exist.

\hypertarget{sparse-matrix-representation}{%
\subsubsection{Sparse matrix
representation}\label{sparse-matrix-representation}}

In a large data set, less common codes are more likely to appear,
resulting in more nearly empty columns in the patient-visit matrix.
Since this representation is used primarily to facilitate calculation of
huge datasets, we ignore the fact that sparse format may be less
efficient than dense for small datasets. Row-major representation also
makes sense, with each row corresponding to a patient-visit. This is
done in step \ref{itm:gensparse} of the algorithm.

The comorbidity matrix is more sparse than the patient-visit matrix, but
is implemented as a dense data structure in step \ref{itm:gendense} of
the algorithm for two reasons: firstly, linear algebra software is often
optimized for row-major sparse multiplications with dense matrices;
secondly, this matrix has a maximum size limited by the comorbidity
definitions, so does not need to scale with very large numbers of
patients. For example, ignoring the problem reduction step described
above, the maximum size of the ICD-9 AHRQ comorbidity matrix is:
\(14678 \times 30 \times 4 = 1.8 \times 10^6\), i.e., less than two
megabytes,\footnote{Again the calculation is done using a 32-bit word
  for each flag.} which compares favorably to the eight megabyte CPU
cache in the modest workstation used in the benchmarks presented in
Section \ref{results}.

There is a detailed example below in Section \ref{workedex}, but a
better idea of the bulk structure of this matrix can be seen below for a
fictitious comorbidity map with five categories, and also in Figure
\ref{fig:comorbidmatrix}. Note that the code represented by the last row
appears in the first and third comorbidities, whereas the others are all
unique to one comorbidity. \[ B_{p,q} =
\begin{matrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

\end{matrix}\]\label{eq:bulk}

\hypertarget{matrix-multiplication}{%
\subsubsection{Matrix multiplication}\label{matrix-multiplication}}

This section first describes steps \ref{itm:gensparse} and
\ref{itm:gendense} of the algorithm in Section
\ref{algorithm-for-comorbidity-computation}. Let \(\boldsymbol{A}\)
represent the matrix of comorbidities associated with each
patient-visit, where each row, \(m\), is a patient-visit, and each
column, \(n\), represents a different code. Each cell of the matrix is
therefore either unity or zero. Unity indicating that the patient-visit
on row \(m\) is associated with the code on column \(n\); or zero, if
not.

\[\boldsymbol{A}_{m,n} =
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
\end{pmatrix}\]\label{eq:A}

Let matrix B be the comorbidity map, where each row, \(p\), represents a
different code, and each column, \(q\), represents a comorbidity.

\[ \boldsymbol{B}_{p,q} =
\begin{pmatrix}
b_{1,1} & b_{1,2} & \cdots & b_{1,q} \\
b_{2,1} & b_{2,2} & \cdots & b_{2,q} \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
b_{p,1} & b_{p,2} & \cdots & b_{p,q}
\end{pmatrix}\]\label{eq:B}

Given there are tens or hundreds of thousands of possible ICD-9 or
ICD-10 codes, the possible width of \(\boldsymbol{A}\) is large (\(n\)
columns). There are also many ICD codes for each comorbidity, so the
height of \(\boldsymbol{B}\) is large (\(p\) rows), although typical
comorbidity maps only cover a subset of possible codes. Many data sets
have tens of millions of patient-visits, each with typically up to 30
diagnostic codes, the mean being around five to ten, depending on the
dataset, so the memory requirement using lower estimates, using four
bytes per flag,\footnote{A \proglang{C++} \code{int} is used for each
  comorbidity flag, which is typically, in 2018, a four-byte word.
  However, the matrices used by \pkg{icd} hold only true or false
  values, represented as 1 or 0. It appears inefficient to use an entire
  \code{int}. An alternative is bit-packing of 32 \texttt{bool} bits
  into each \code{int}, which has a stormy history in the \proglang{C++}
  Standard Template Library
  \citep{Jarvi_AlgorithmSpecializationGeneric_2006}, and, more
  importantly, is not supported by any major linear algebra library.} is
\(10^7 \times 10^4 \times 4 = 4 \times 10^{11}\), which is 400 gigabytes
simply to represent the patient-visit to disease relationships.

Since the integer levels of the \texttt{factor} of ICD codes is common
between the patient-visit and comorbidity matrices, \(n = p\) and the
comorbidities for each patient-visit is their matrix product.

\[\boldsymbol{C}_{m,q} =
\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{B} =
\begin{pmatrix}
c_{1,1} & c_{1,2} & \cdots & c_{1,q} \\
c_{2,1} & c_{2,2} & \cdots & c_{2,q} \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
c_{m,1} & c_{m,2} & \cdots & c_{m,q}
\end{pmatrix}\]\label{eq:C}

\hypertarget{workedex}{%
\subsection{Worked example using ICD-10 codes}\label{workedex}}

Take four patient-visits with the following ICD-10 codes in wide format,
seen in Table \ref{tab:workedexinput}, and this simple comorbidity map:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> list(
R>   "Rheumatic Heart Disease" = "I098",
R>   "Hypertension" = c("I10", "I11"),
R>   "Heart failure" = c("I50", "I110")
R> )
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\begin{longtable}{l|l|l|l}
\hline
Patient-Visit & Code 1 & Code 2 & Code 3\\
\hline
Encounter one & K401 &  & \\
\hline
Encounter two & I0981 & C450 & \\
\hline
Encounter three & M352 & I10 & \\
\hline
Encounter four & I110 & H40001 & I10\\
\hline
\caption{\label{tab:workedexinput}Four patient-visits with some ICD-10 codes in `wide' format for worked example}\\
\end{longtable}

There are several things to note, which represent common features in
real health care data:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are patient-visit codes which do not appear in the comorbidity
  map.
\item
  There are codes in the comorbidity map which do not appear in the
  patient-visit codes.
\item
  I11 appears in one comorbidity and its child code I110 appears in
  another.
\item
  Patient two has code I0981, but only the parent code I098 appears in
  the comorbidity map.
\end{itemize}

Let \(\boldsymbol{A}\) be a simplified set of patient-visits, where the
columns represent the ICD-10 codes I0981 (rheumatic heart failure), I10
(essential hypertension), and I110 (hypertensive heart disease with
heart failure). Again, each row is a different patient-visit.

Let \(\boldsymbol{B}\) be a simplified comorbidity map, where the
columns represent congestive heart failure and hypertension, in that
order. Note that 110 is found in both these comorbidities.

\[\boldsymbol{A} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad
\boldsymbol{B} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad
\boldsymbol{C} = \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{B} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 1
\end{pmatrix}\]\label{eq:ABC}

Note that cell \(\boldsymbol{C}_{4,2} = 2\), because the condition I110
is in two comorbidities, so the final result can be given as a logical
matrix \(\boldsymbol{C} \neq 0\) Thus, the final result is:

\[(\boldsymbol{C} \neq 0) =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}\]\label{eq:Clogical}

Table \ref{tab:cmbresult} shows how this can be represented to the user.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

There are now three active CRAN packages which calculate comorbidities:
\pkg{icd}, \pkg{medicalrisk} \citep{medicalriskpkg}, and
\pkg{comorbidity} \citep{comorbiditypkg}. The latter two work using the
strategy described in the pseudocode in Section \ref{pseudocode}.

The following is a limited performance comparison using synthetic data.
This synthetic data shares some characteristics of real data: firstly,
the more patients there are, the more coverage there is of the entire
code space of the ICD scheme; secondly, there are both valid and invalid
ICD codes; thirdly, each patient is assigned twenty codes. From the
author's experience, the mean number of codes per patient is around five
to ten, so twenty per patient represents twenty a mild stress-test of
the algorithms.

Figure \ref{fig:versus} shows time to compute comorbidites for
increasing numbers of rows of data, showing \pkg{icd} is dramatically
faster than the alternatives. Lines are fitted from where the
relationship becomes linear at 10,000 rows of data, and these are used
to extrapolate to estimates of the much larger computations seen in
Figure \ref{fig:bigdata}. Figure \ref{fig:speedup} shows the relative
speed up \pkg{icd} offers in comparison to the alternatives.

\subsection{Derivation of the comorbidity
maps}\label{derivation-of-the-comorbidity-maps}}

It is important to have a reproducible audit trail for foundational
work, so \pkg{icd} contains code which parses \proglang{SAS} source code
in order to derive the original intent of the author in how the
comorbidity maps were implemented. The AHRQ and
\citeauthor{quan_updating_2011} provide such \proglang{SAS} source code,
whereas other maps are only available in the form of tabulated data in
journal articles.

\hypertarget{parsing-original-sas-code}{%
\subsubsection{Parsing original SAS
code}\label{parsing-original-sas-code}}

For example, \citeauthor{quan_updating_2011} offer the following code
for pulmonary disease in the ICD-9 Charlson map. The lines split for
clarity.

\begin{verbatim}
%LET DC6=%STR('4168','4169',
'490','491','492','493','494','495','496',
'500','501','502','503','504','505',
'5064','5081','5088');
\end{verbatim}

Note that 497 -- 499 are undefined in ICD-9. What should be done if 497
appears in a data set? Here an argument is made that this is completely
invalid. Firstly, see the sub-chapter definitions:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> sc <- c("Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease And Allied Conditions",
R+         "Pneumoconioses And Other Lung Diseases Due To External Agents")
R> icd9_sub_chapters[sc]
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
$`Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease And Allied Conditions`
start   end 
"490" "496" 

$`Pneumoconioses And Other Lung Diseases Due To External Agents`
start   end 
"500" "508" 
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

497 is not a valid code itself. It could be a typo for any of the other
combinations, of which four are completely different, yet valid codes:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> explain_code(c("497", "479", "947", "974", "749", "794"), warn = FALSE)
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Cleft palate and cleft lip"                                 
[2] "Nonspecific abnormal results of function studies"           
[3] "Burn of internal organs"                                    
[4] "Poisoning by water, mineral, and uric acid metabolism drugs"
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

There are also many other ways the coder may have made the error other
than a permutation of the intended code. Given the wide range of disease
processes, and no guarantee at all that the coder made a mistake only in
the last digit, \pkg{icd} discards the code to avoid giving a false
positive comorbidity flag.

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> "497" %in% icd9_map_charlson
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] FALSE
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The comorbidity maps are therefore constructed by generously including
all children (valid or invalid) of the explicitly defined three-digit
codes, but they do not extrapolate to other three-digit codes. Suppose
additional digits were defined by a country's extension of ICD-9, but do
not appear in the WHO or ICD-9-CM definitions. \pkg{icd} already
includes all possible structurally valid ICD-9 child codes in the map.
This can be seen here, where two fictitious decimal places are seen in
the map, but not three:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> "49699" %in% icd9_map_quan_deyo[["Pulmonary"]]
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] TRUE
\end{CodeOutput}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> "496999" %in% icd9_map_charlson
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] FALSE
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

More generosity is offered when calculating the comorbidities, so even
if invalid codes appear, the intent of this code to fall within the
pulmonary comorbidity hierarchy is clear enough:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> alice <- data.frame(id = "alice", icd9 = "49699")
R> comorbid_charlson(alice, return_df = TRUE)[["Pulmonary"]]
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] TRUE
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{parsing-range-definitions}{%
\subsubsection{Parsing range
definitions}\label{parsing-range-definitions}}

For some mappings, no source code was available, but the comorbidities
are described in journals using ranges. e.g., in the ICD-9 Elixhauser
mapping, we find 243 -- 244.2 in the thyroid disease definition. This is
a subset of the entire range of thyroid disesases in ICD-9: 244.3, 244.8
and 244.9 also exist. \pkg{icd} takes great care with false positives
here by carefully excluding parent codes which might have been captured
by a pattern matching approach. In this case, 244 should not be
considered a match because it includes codes where which were clearly
excluded. A number of ICD code range operators are defined to facilitate
this:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> head("243" %i9da% "244.2")
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "243"    "243.0"  "243.00" "243.01" "243.02" "243.03"
\end{CodeOutput}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> "244" %in% ("243" %i9da% "244.2")
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] FALSE
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Note that 244 is too broad to fit the original Elixhauser description,
because it implies all its children, which would go beyond 244.2.

\subsection{Other Functionality}\label{other-functionality}}

\hypertarget{validation}{%
\subsubsection{Validation}\label{validation}}

\pkg{icd} allows checking whether codes are valid, and, in the USA,
whether they are `billable', i.e., leaf nodes, or merely intermediate
members of the hierarchy. Research and clinical data may also contain
relevant non-billable codes, and this is accounted for by the
comorbidity calculations.

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> is_valid(c("441", "441.0", "441.01", "XXX"))
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
\end{CodeOutput}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> is_billable(c("441", "441.0", "441.01", "XXX"))
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
\end{CodeOutput}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> head(
R+   data.frame(code = children("441"),
R+              billable = is_billable(children("441"))))
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
   code billable
1   441    FALSE
2  4410    FALSE
3 44100     TRUE
4 44101     TRUE
5 44102     TRUE
6 44103     TRUE
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{hierarchy-and-explanation}{%
\subsubsection{Hierarchy and
explanation}\label{hierarchy-and-explanation}}

Functions are provided to navigate the ICD-9 and ICD-10 hierarchies.
This example first takes the children of the ICD-9 code 441.0:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> children("441")
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
 [1] "441"   "4410"  "44100" "44101" "44102" "44103" "4411"  "4412" 
 [9] "4413"  "4414"  "4415"  "4416"  "4417"  "4419" 
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Several five-digit codes begin with 4410. \texttt{explain\_code}
condenses all these children to their common parent, before interpreting
the ICD code:

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> explain_code(children("4410"))
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Dissection of aorta"
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

What does each one mean?

\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeInput}
R> explain_code(children("4410"), condense = FALSE)
\end{CodeInput}

\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "Dissection of aorta"                  
[2] "Dissection of aorta, unspecified site"
[3] "Dissection of aorta, thoracic"        
[4] "Dissection of aorta, abdominal"       
[5] "Dissection of aorta, thoracoabdominal"
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{software-libraries}{%
\subsection{Software libraries}\label{software-libraries}}

This package is built on the strong foundations of \proglang{R}
\citep{R_2018}, \pkg{Rcpp}
\citep{Eddelbuettel_RcppSeamlessIntegration_2011}, \pkg{RcppEigen}
\citep{Eddelbeuttel_FastElegantNumerical_2013}, and \pkg{Eigen}
\citep*{Guennebaud_Eigen_2017}, the highly optimized \proglang{C++}
linear algebra library. Eigen was chosen because of its performance
oriented approach to matrix multiplication using advanced x86
instructions when possible, and, in the case of the row-major sparse
multiplication with a dense matrix, a multi-threaded solution. Once this
was done, the bottlenecks moved to the data preparation before the
matrix multiplication, which itself was optimized by simple R techniques
such as vectorization.

\hypertarget{extensions}{%
\subsection{Extensions}\label{extensions}}

\proglang{R}'s S3 class system is used for extensibility, so it is
straightforward to include additional ICD schemes, e.g., for different
national systems. Likewise, it is also easy to add new comorbidity maps,
or use user-defined ones. Several authors have contributed code which
extends \pkg{icd} to solve other problems:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Van Walraven risk scores
  \citep{vanWalraven_modificationElixhausercomorbidity_2009}, analogous
  to Charlson scores, based on the Elixhauser comomribidites.
\item
  assignment of CMS HCC categories
  \citep{Evans_EvaluationCMSHCCRisk_2011, Pope_RiskadjustmentMedicare_2004}
\item
  emulation of the AHRQ CCS
  \citep{AgencyforHealthcareResearchandQuality_ClinicalClassificationsSoftware_2012}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{limitations-and-future-work}{%
\section{Limitations and future
work}\label{limitations-and-future-work}}

In general, computation of comorbidities as used in medical research
ignores the fact that both the comorbidity maps and the ICD schemes
change from year-to-year. \pkg{icd} takes the approach to be inclusive
where appropriate, so extra or missing codes result in the same or very
similar comorbidity results. An extension could compute comorbidities
using the correct annual revision according to the year of the patient
encounter.

Many countries have their own variations on the WHO ICD codes, and these
are not yet included in \pkg{icd}. These may affect comorbidity
calculations. Also missing are WHO versions of ICD codes, which may be
possible in the future, dependent upon licensing restrictions.

The synthetic data used for benchmarking contained real and invalid
codes. More benchmarking could be done using real data with different
proportions of invalid codes, and different distributions of codes.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

\pkg{icd} gives \proglang{R} the ability to do a common medical research
task by doing fast and accurate conversion of ICD-9 and ICD-10 into
comorbidities. The key innovations are: the reduction of the problem to
an equivalent smaller task; and the use of sparse matrix multiplication
to compute comorbidities. This solution offers an efficient and elegant
method that reduces time and memory complexity. The benchmarks show that
this technique scales to the biggest health care data sets, and answers
the goal of making this possible with modest computing power in a
reproducible workflow.
