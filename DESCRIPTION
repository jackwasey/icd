Title: Tools for Working with ICD-9 and ICD-10 Codes, and Finding Comorbidities
Description: Calculate comorbidities, Charlson scores, perform fast and accurate
    validation, conversion, manipulation, filtering and comparison of ICD-9 and
    ICD-10 codes. Common ambiguities and code formats are handled. This
    package enables a work flow from raw lists of ICD codes in hospital
    billing databases to comorbidities. ICD-9 and ICD-10 comorbidity mappings
    from Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included. This
    package replaces 'icd9', which can now be uninstalled.
