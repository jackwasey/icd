Package: icd9
Title: Tools for Working with ICD-9 Codes, and Finding Comorbidities
Description: This package allows accurate manipulation, conversion, validation
    and comparison of ICD-9-CM (clinical modification) codes. Although ICD-9
    codes appear numeric, this is not the case, since trailing zeroes, and a
    mixture of decimal and non-decimal "short" format codes exist. Tools to map
    ICD-9 codes to co-morbidities are also provided, with mappings from Quan
    (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included.
