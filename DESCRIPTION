Package: icd9
Title: Tools for Working with ICD-9 Codes, and Finding Comorbidities
Description: Calculate comorbidities, Charlson scores, perform fast and accurate
    validation, conversion, manipulation, filtering and comparison of ICD-9-CM
    (clinical modification) codes. ICD-9 codes appear numeric but leading and
    trailing zeroes, and both decimal and non-decimal "short" format codes
    exist. The package enables a work flow from raw lists of ICD-9 codes from
    hospital billing databases to comorbidities. ICD-9 to comorbidity mappings
    from Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included. Any
    other mapping of codes, such as ICD-10, to comorbidities can be used.
