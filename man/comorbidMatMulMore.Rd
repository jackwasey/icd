\title{Comorbidity calculation as a matrix multiplication}
\usage{
comorbidMatMulMore(icd9df, icd9Mapping, visitId, icd9Field)
}
\description{
The problem is that the matrices could be huge: the patient-icd matrix would
be millions of patient rows, and ~15000 columns for all AHRQ comorbidities.
}
\details{
Several ways of reducing the problem: firstly, as with existing code, we can
drop any ICD codes from the map which are not in the patient data. With many
patients, this will be less effective as the long tail becomes apparent.
However, with the (small) Vermont data, we see ~15,000 codes being reduced to
339.

\section{Sparse matrices}{

Using sparse matrices is another solution. Building
the initial matrix may become a significant part of the calculation, but once
done, the solution could be a simple matrix multiplication, which is
potentially highly optimized (Eigen, BLAS, GPU, etc.)
}

\section{Eigen}{

Eigen has parallel (non-GPU) optimized sparse row-major *
dense matrix. Patients-ICD matrix must be the row-major sparse one, so the
dense matrix is then the comorbidity map
