\title{Filters data frame based on present-on-arrival flag}
\usage{
icd9FilterPoa(icd9df, poaField = "poa", poa = icd9PoaChoices)

icd9FilterPoaYes(icd9df, poaField = "poa")

icd9FilterPoaNo(icd9df, poaField = "poa")

icd9FilterPoaNotNo(icd9df, poaField = "poa")

icd9FilterPoaNotYes(icd9df, poaField = "poa")
}
\arguments{
\item{icd9df}{data frame containing columns for visitId (which is the feault
name), icd9 (default for the icd9 code), and  maybe also a POA flag.}

\item{poaField}{The name of column in the data frame which contains the
Present On Arrival flag. The flag itself is a single character, typically
one of "Y", "N", "E", "X", "U" or empty. The poaField is a character vector
of length one.}

\item{poa}{single character value, being one of \code{poaChoices} whether to
account for co-morbidities flagged as present-on-arrival. This is not a
simple binary, since many codes are exempt, unspecified, or unknown.
\code{poaField} gives the choices: yes, not no, no, not yes. The
intermediate codes, such as "exempt", "unknown" and \code{NA} mean that
"yes" is not the same as "not no."}
}
\description{
Present On Arrival (POA) is not a simple flag, since many codes
  are exempt, unspecified, or unknown. Therefore, two options are given: get
  all the comorbidities where the POA flag was definitely -ve, coded as "N"
  or definitely +ve and coded as "Y". Negating one set won't give the other
  set unless all codes were either Y or N. #describeIn icd9Comorbid
