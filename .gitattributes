# WIP:
# need to run:
# git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
# for local PNG/PDF friendly diffing to work
*.png diff=png
*.pdf diff=pdf

## git config diff.nodiff.command /usr/bin/true or /bin/true
# *RcppExports* diff=nodiff
# *.Rd diff=nodiff
## git config then has 'merge.theirs.driver true'
# *RcppExports* merge=theirs
